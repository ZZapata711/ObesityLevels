# School Project - Multivariate Statistics
Performing different multivate statistical analyses on Obesity data obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
Different statistical tests were performed, as well as Dimensionality Reduction using PCA and Factor Analysis
My final goal was to use Dimensionality Reduction techniques learned in class in order to choose 5 variables for use in an LDA/QDA model in order to classify one's obesity level using the given input.
